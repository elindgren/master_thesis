\chapter{Model variability in Zorro}
\label{app:zorro_model_uncertainty}

In this chapter, a short investigation into the model uncertainty in Zorro for GCN for sex prediction will be presented. In \cref{fig:zorro_model_uncertainty}, standard deviation in the importance score for each node from two different versions of Zorro are presented. $\sigma_{\rm{Subject}}\left(\mathcal{I}\right)$ refers to the standard deviation when Zorro was run for a single GCN model, where Zorro was repeated for 23 different groups of 200 subjects each, with the uncertainty evaluated over the results for the 23 different groups. This corresponds to the uncertainty presented for GCN for sex prediction presented in \cref{sec:results_analysis_sex}. $\sigma_{\rm{Model}}\left(\mathcal{I}\right)$ refers to running Zorro for a single group of 200 subjects, but repeated for ten different model initialisations of GCN. Comparing the results, we observe that the uncertainties are of comparable size, but that $\sigma_{\rm{Subject}}\left(\mathcal{I}\right)$ is generally slightly higher except for some nodes. From this reason, we draw the conclusion that the uncertainties in Zorro with regards to varying model, $\sigma_{\rm{Model}}\left(\mathcal{I}\right)$, are not negligible but are smaller than the uncertainty when varying subjects, $\sigma_{\rm{Subject}}\left(\mathcal{I}\right)$. Thus, the more interesting uncertainty is the one regarding subject uncertainty, but varying model uncertainty would be interesting to investigate in a possible future work where time is not an issue.

Observe that $\sigma_{\rm{Subject}}\left(\mathcal{I}\right) > \sigma_{\rm{Model}}\left(\mathcal{I}\right)$ for most nodes.}
